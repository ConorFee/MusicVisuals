# How it works
For Marks(C22470414) Visual:
Class Declaration: This is the main class of the program, named "test". It extends a class called "Visual".
Variables: Various variables are declared to hold data like audio amplitude, sizes, colors, and timing information.
settings(): This method sets up the size and rendering mode of the window.
setup(): This method initializes the program. It sets up audio processing, loads an audio file, initializes arrays, sets initial values for visual elements.
draw(): This method is the main loop of the program. It checks if an introductory animation is done. If not, it runs the introduction. If the intro is done, it processes the audio, calculates amplitudes, adjusts the visual elements based on the music, draws the visuals, and manages audio playback timing.
intro(): This method handles the introduction animation, displaying text on the screen with fading effects.
drawXShape(): This method draws X shapes on the screen. It adjusts the thickness and color of the lines based on parameters passed to it.
The program essentially listens to music, analyzes its characteristics, and creates visual patterns based on that analysis. It also includes an introduction animation at the beginning.
